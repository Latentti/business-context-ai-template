# END OF ENTERPRISE TEMPLATE

# ENTERPRISE TEMPLATE COMPLETION GUIDANCE:
#
# Estimated Time: 16-40 hours depending on organizational complexity
#
# Recommended Approach:
# 1. Executive sponsor assigns EA lead
# 2. Gather existing documentation (strategy docs, architecture, compliance)
# 3. Interview key stakeholders across BUs
# 4. Fill Priority 1 sections first (Sections 1, 4, 5, 10, 15)
# 5. Expand with BU-specific detail
# 6. Review with governance bodies
# 7. Validate with compliance and security
# 8. Publish and socialize
# 9. Establish quarterly update cadence
#
# Complexity Considerations:
# - Multi-BU organizations: Document each BU's unique aspects
# - Multi-geography: Address regional variations
# - Complex compliance: Detail all applicable regulations
# - Large app portfolio: May need separate application catalog
# - M&A activity: Document integration status
#
# This enterprise template serves as comprehensive business context for:
# - AI-driven development aligned with enterprise architecture
# - Ensuring solutions fit into enterprise technology landscape
# - Respecting enterprise governance and compliance
# - Leveraging enterprise capabilities and avoiding duplication
# - Aligning with enterprise strategy and transformation programs
