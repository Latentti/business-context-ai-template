## TEMPLATE USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

# This template serves as an "AI pitch" - a structured business context document that enables
# AI development tools (like BMad) to understand your business environment, objectives, and
# constraints when developing software solutions.
#
# FILL IN ALL SECTIONS that are relevant to your business. Remove or mark as "N/A" sections
# that don't apply. The more complete and accurate this context, the better AI can align
# development work with your business objectives.
