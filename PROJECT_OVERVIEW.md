# Business Context AI Template - Project Overview

## 📦 What Is This?

A complete, ready-to-publish GitHub repository providing templates and documentation for creating business context for AI development tools.

**Problem Solved**: Organizations waste 2-4 hours per project explaining business context to AI tools. This template lets you create business context once and reference it in every project.

**Target Audience**: Product teams, CTOs, tech leads, business analysts, enterprise architects - anyone using AI-assisted development.
