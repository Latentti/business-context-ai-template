### Adding a New Example

If contributing a filled example template:

1. **Remove all confidential information**
   - Company names (use fictional names)
   - Specific metrics (use realistic but fictional numbers)
   - Customer names
   - Financial details

2. **Make it realistic**
   - Based on real patterns
   - Includes common challenges
   - Shows real-world complexity

3. **Follow naming convention**
   - `examples/[industry]-[company-type]-example.yaml`
   - E.g., `examples/healthcare-saas-startup-example.yaml`

4. **Include a README section** explaining:
   - What type of company this represents
   - What makes this example useful
   - Key patterns demonstrated

### Improving Core Templates

When suggesting changes to core templates:

1. **Explain the rationale** - Why is this improvement valuable?
2. **Show examples** - Demonstrate the improvement with concrete examples
3. **Consider backward compatibility** - How does this affect existing users?
4. **Update documentation** - Ensure docs reflect template changes

## Documentation Contributions
